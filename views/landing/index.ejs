      <h1>Hello World, I'm Jonathan!</h1>

      <p>This project of mine serves both as a minor suggestion for <span>RedMart</span> and also a practice for myself while exploration with Google Maps API real time location tracking </p>

      <p>On 28-Dec-16, I realised <span>RedMart</span> had yet to implement any delivery tracking for customers so I thought it would be fun if customers can view where their assigned delivery <span>RedMartian</span> would be during their chosen delivery time slot.</p>

      <p>Real time data is drawn from taxi-availability API, which returns only lat/lng coordinates of unhired Taxis in Singapore. The coordinates are arranged from west to east. Once a taxi is hired, its coordinates are untracked from the API.</p>

      <p>
        For demonstration purposes 2 demo accounts are available for this project: <br>
        Tom (<strong>tom@email.com</strong>) &amp; Mika (<strong>mika@email.com</strong>). <br>
        Both their passwords are <strong>12345678</strong>.
      </p>

      <p> I randomly chose the 350th and 1000th coordinates from the array and assigned to Tom and Mika respectively.</p>

      <p>Click on <span>Login</span> for a preview. Lastly, only the search bar and the login button works. Thank you for your time! :)</p>
